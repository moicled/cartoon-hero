    <h2>what's the sitch</h2>
    <p>"I can do anything" Is the code she lives by. 
        And with Kim being a high school student and freelance hero/vigilante, 
        she proves that nothing is impossible for a possible. This captain of the cheerleadering squad
    balances making the grade in class with saving the world. Kim is a born leader who unable to resist a challenge; 
    is driven to excel; a perfectionist, and she is very protective of those close to her. 
    However Kim has her faults . She is still a teenage girl and therefore susceptible to most normal teenage 
    insecurities and growing pains. She is occasionally embarrassed by her parents, pouts when she does not get her way 
    and has a strong desire to fit in; the latter of which is shown to be one of her biggest weaknesses as a person. 
This shows all that even though she can anything she is still human, but that makes her more likeable as a person.</p>
